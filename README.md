Linux / System Administration notes for [Zim Wiki](http://www.zim-wiki.org/)

This is a huge dump of system administration, DevOps, Programming and Scripting notes taken in [Zim Wiki](http://www.zim-wiki.org/). In order to use these notes you must download Zim Wiki (available for Windows, Mac, and Linux) and import these notes using the following steps

1) git clone git@github.com:Timothy-Pulliam/Linux_Administration_Notes.git
2) open Zim Wiki and add a new notebook. Browse to the location you cloned the notes in.

That should be it. I am adding new notes all the time. Feel free to pull from the repo frequently to keep them up to date.
