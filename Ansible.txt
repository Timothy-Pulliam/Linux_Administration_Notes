==== Shell Commands through ansible ====

Suppose you want to run lsblk on all systems in the group "workstation". You create a file named **hosts** with the following contents, then run the command that follows.

'''
[workstations]
host1
host2
host3
'''


''$ ansible workstations -i hosts -m shell -a lsblk''

==== Hello World ====
$ touch hosts play.yml

hosts
'''
[all]
$10.1.155.1
'''


play.yml
'''
---
- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - ping:
'''

$ yum install -y yamllint
$ yamllint play.yml
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts play.yml --user tpulliam --ask-pass
