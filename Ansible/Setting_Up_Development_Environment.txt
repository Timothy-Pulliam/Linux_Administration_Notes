Installing Autocomplete-Ansible

If you get the following error, you don't have ansible installed. You must install ansible using the recommended method, or activating you virtual environment.

==== Environment With Vim ====
Install Vim-Plug plugin manager, or equivalent
https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug

Run the following command
'''
$ curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
'''

If you want to install vim-plug automatically using a .vimrc file, include the following in you .vimrc
'''
if empty(glob('~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim'))
  silent !curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs
    \ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
  autocmd VimEnter * PlugInstall --sync | source $MYVIMRC
endif
'''


Next install the ansible-vim plug from vimawesome. This will give you syntax highlighting for YAML files as well as autoindent. You can install the ansible-vim plugin by placing the following in you .vimrc file
https://vimawesome.com/plugin/ansible-vim

'''
" Specify a directory for plugins
" - For Neovim: ~/.local/share/nvim/plugged
" - Avoid using standard Vim directory names like 'plugin'
call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')

" Shorthand notation; fetches https://github.com/pearofducks/ansible-vim
Plug 'pearofducks/ansible-vim'

" Initialize plugin system
call plug#end()
'''


Then run the following commands. You should see the following output.
