====== Creating The Ansible User ======
Created Sunday 01 October 2017

The ansible user is the user that will actually run any configuration changes. These changes should not be run as root, instead as the ansible user with sudo privileges. This playbook creates that user. Note, the password is **changeme** and was generated with this python2.7 one (two?) liner.

'''
$ pip install passlib
$ python -c "from passlib.hash import sha512_crypt; import getpass; print sha512_crypt.using(rounds=5000).hash(getpass.getpass())"
