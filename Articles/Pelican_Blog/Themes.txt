==== Themes ====

Pelican themes are managed using the pelican-themes command.

get help with command
pelican-themes -h

List installed themes (optionally increase verbosity)
pelican-themes -l -v

In a virtual environment, themes will be located at the following path
$ pelican-themes -p
~/project/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pelican/themes



==== Using Themes from the Pelican Themes Github ====
https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes

This is probably the easiest way to use alternative themes for pelican. The only problem is that you will be limited to the themes available to the github repo.

Clone pelican themes repo into [[~/project/output/]] then tell pelican which theme to use by setting pelicanconf.py

THEME = "./output/pelican-themes/theme-name"

== Installing New Themes ==

Sometimes you want to try out a theme that is not in the repository.

Visit http://www.pelicanthemes.com/ and find a theme that you want to use. Once you have found one, down load it.

You will be taken to the github page of the theme where you can clone the theme.

The theme is now ready to use. To instruct pelican to use the new theme, edit the pelicanconf.py file
