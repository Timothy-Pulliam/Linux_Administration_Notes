The AIX operating system uses the Virtual Memory Manager (VMM) to control memory and paging space on the system. The VMM maintains a list of free (unallocated) page frames that it uses to satisfy page faults. AIX tries to use all of RAM all of the time, except for a small amount which it maintains on the free list

Pretty straight forward stuff. The available column shows how much real memory is available without swapping.

==== Computational vs Non Computational Pages ====


The topas command presents real memory in the following format. We are looking for the amount of memory used by computational pages, since that is the only form of **Non-Cache** memory.

$ topas
....
'''
MEMORY
Real,MB   31744
% Comp     51
% Noncomp  39
% Client   39

From the official AIX manual

	The memory statistics are listed below.
	Real Shows the actual physical memory of the system in megabytes.
	* %Comp Reports real memory allocated to computational pages.
	* %Noncomp Reports real memory allocated to non-computational pages (**cache**).
	* %Client Reports on the amount of memory that is currently used to cache
	remotely mounted files.

VMM - is the virtual memory manager, a process that is part of the kernel 
and is responsible for managing 
memory. 

Virtual memory is real memory plus disk space (both addresses to data on 
disks and paging space) 

Non-Computational memory pages are pages of real memory that contain data that has a persistent location on disk (executable code of a command, data from a file, etc. not from data stored in paging space). This would be a form of **Cache**.

Computational memory pages are pages of real memory that do not have a persistent location on disk, they are pages of memory needed by a process when it is started and no longer available when the process terminates. These are pages in memory that contain things like process stack and heap, and malloced space. When memory becomes over committed these pages need to be stored someplace temporarily and that is on paging space. 

Another way to view this is with the vmstat command.

$ vmstat -v
...
...
51.5 percentage of memory used for computational pages
