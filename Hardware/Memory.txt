from wikipedia

The term static differentiates SRAM from DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) which must be periodically refreshed. SRAM is faster and more expensive than DRAM; it is typically used for CPU cache while DRAM is used for a computer's main memory.

SRAM has the following characteristics

Advantages:
* Low power consumption
* Simplicity â€“ a refresh circuit is not needed
* Reliability
* Speed

Disadvantages:
* Price
* Capacity
