Created Wednesday 02 May 2018

==== Overview ====
https://www.opencsw.org/package/alternatives/
[[OpenCSW]] is a better (???) package manager for solaris. To install it run the following commands


== Installation ==
pkgadd -d http://get.opencsw.org/now
/opt/csw/bin/pkgutil -U
/opt/csw/bin/pkgutil -y -i alternatives 
/usr/sbin/pkgchk -L CSWalternatives # list files

==== Full Setup ====
https://www.opencsw.org/manual/for-administrators/setup.html

You will then need to add [[OpenCSW]] binaries and man pages to your path. You can accomplish this by adding the following to either your [[/etc/profile]] (recommended) or to /root/.bashrc

	 ''# Add OpenCSW package manager to path''
'''
export PATH=/opt/csw/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin
export MANPATH=/opt/csw/share/man:/usr/share/man
'''


'''
# source /root/.bashrc
# source /etc/profile
'''


== Patching the system ==
Make sure you upgrade both IPS and OpenCSW

# pkgutil --upgrade
# pkg update
