====== Zones ======
Created Tuesday 01 May 2018

==== Overview ====
Zones are basically virtual machines. The hypervisor is sometimes referred to as the CDOM (Controller Domain) and the Guest OSes are reffered to as LDOMs.

All zones reside within the default global zone (CDOM or Controller Domain). The global zone is essentially the host OS and all other zones act as the guest OSes.

* Booting the global zone is equivalent to booting the system hardware.
* Each zone, including the global zone, is assigned a zone name. The global zone always has the name "global".
* Each zone is assigned a unique numeric identifier. The global zone always has the identifier ID 0.
* Each zone has a path to its root directory that is relative to the global zone's root directory.
* The global zone is the only zone from which a non-global zone can be configured and installed.

==== Basic Commands ====
SSH into the CDOM (controller domain)

list all LDOMs
$ ldm list

Stop an LDOM (power it off). Optionally supply the -f flag
$ sudo ldm stop [-f] $LDOM

Start an LDOM (power it on)
$ sudo ldm start $LDOM

You can console into an LDOM by telnetting into the port the LDOM is listening on. When you run 'ldm list' you will get a column which looks like the following

UART
5002
5003
5000

These are TCP ports on the CDOM that the LDOM is listening to. For example, if you want to console into the LDOM on port 5000 from the CDOM, you would run

$ telnet localhost 5000
