Summary      : Provides dynamic modification of a user's environment
URL          : http://modules.sourceforge.net/
License      : GPLv2+
Description  : The Environment Modules package provides for the dynamic modification of
             : a user's environment via modulefiles.
             : 
             : Each modulefile contains the information needed to configure the shell
             : for an application. Once the Modules package is initialized, the
             : environment can be modified on a per-module basis using the module
             : command which interprets modulefiles. Typically modulefiles instruct
             : the module command to alter or set shell environment variables such as
             : PATH, MANPATH, etc. modulefiles may be shared by many users on a system
             : and users may have their own collection to supplement or replace the
             : shared modulefiles.
             : 
             : Modules can be loaded and unloaded dynamically and atomically, in an
             : clean fashion. All popular shells are supported, including bash, ksh,
             : zsh, sh, csh, tcsh, as well as some scripting languages such as perl.
             : 
             : Modules are useful in managing different versions of applications.
             : Modules can also be bundled into metamodules that will load an entire
             : suite of different applications.
             : 
             : NOTE: You will need to get a new shell after installing this package to
             : have access to the module alias.

==== Load Averages ====
https://serverfault.com/questions/348933/explain-load-averages-on-solaris-10

On older-solaris, the load-average is the average number of runnable and running threads. In other words, it is the number of threads running on the CPUs, plus the number of threads in the run queue, waiting for CPUs, averaged over time.

So... a CPU that completed processing 10 threads for the last second... and had 5 more waiting to be processed would show 15.

In contrast...

Linux load averages are calculated as "overload" of a CPU... i.e. during the last period of time, how many threads were waiting for CPU time over how many were completed. (as a percentage)

So... a CPU that completed processing 10 threads for the last second... and had 5 more waiting to be processed would show 0.5

In Solaris 10... they changed the formula a bit... and I'm not 100% sure what it entails, but it should be pretty-close.


==== Creating ISO Files From CD/DVD ====
https://askubuntu.com/questions/147800/ripping-dvd-to-iso-accurately
	get the info of the cd/dvd you're copying. I havent tried this with a audio cd because i just rip them to flac's .. but the following is a test on a DVD..

'''
[root@sisyphus ~]# isoinfo -d -i /dev/sr1 | grep -i -E 'block size|volume size'
Logical block size is: 2048
Volume size is: 2264834
'''


We use the Logical block size for the BS= variable and Volume size for the COUNT=
	use DD to copy the DVD to an iso:

'''
[root@sisyphus ~]# dd if=/dev/sr1 of=/tmp/test.iso bs=2048 count=2264834
2264834+0 records in
2264834+0 records out
4638380032 bytes (4.6 GB, 4.3 GiB) copied, 373.405 s, 12.4 MB/s
'''


	Test the image against the actual DVD..

'''
[root@sisyphus ~]# md5sum /tmp/test.iso 
d3a2cdd58b8c9ade05786526a4a8eae2  /tmp/test.iso
[root@sisyphus ~]# md5sum /dev/sr1
d3a2cdd58b8c9ade05786526a4a8eae2  /dev/sr1
'''


You can then mount this new ISO file to reveal its filesystem contents.
$ sudo mount [[/tmp/test.iso]] [[/mnt]] -o loop
$ ls [[/mnt]]
