All zones reside within the default global zone. The global zone is essentially the host OS and all other zones act as the guest OSes.

* Booting the global zone is equivalent to booting the system hardware.
* Each zone, including the global zone, is assigned a zone name. The global zone always has the name "global".
* Each zone is assigned a unique numeric identifier. The global zone always has the identifier ID 0.
* Each zone has a path to its root directory that is relative to the global zone's root directory.
* The global zone is the only zone from which a non-global zone can be configured and installed.
