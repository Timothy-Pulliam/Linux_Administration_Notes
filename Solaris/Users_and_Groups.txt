Default File Permissions (umask)

When you create a file or directory, the default file permissions assigned to the file or directory
are controlled by the user mask. The user mask is set by the umask command in a user
initialization file. You can display the current value of the user mask by typing umask and
pressing Return.
The user mask contains the following octal values:
■ The first digit sets permissions for the user
■ The second digit sets permissions for group
■ The third digit sets permissions for other, also referred to as world
Note that if the first digit is zero, it is not displayed. For example, if the user mask is set to 022, 22
is displayed.
To determine the umask value that you want to set, subtract the value of the permissions you
want from 666 (for a file) or 777 (for a directory). The remainder is the value to use with the
umask command. For example, suppose you want to change the default mode for files to 644
(rw-r--r--). The difference between 666 and 644 is 022, which is the value you would use as an
argument to the umask command.
You can also determine the umask value you want to set by using the following table. This table
shows the file and directory permissions that are created for each of the octal values of umask.

TABLE 1–11 Permissions for umask Values
umaskOctal Value File Permissions Directory Permissions

umask octal value 	file permissions	directory permissions
0 			rw- 			rwx
1 			rw- 			rw-
2 			r-- 			r-x
3 			r-- 			r--
4 			-w- 			-wx
5 			-w- 			-w-
6 			--x 			--x
7 			--- (none) 		--- (none)

The following line in a user initialization file sets the default file permissions to rw-rw-rw- and directory permissions to rwxrwxrwx.
