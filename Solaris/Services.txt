====== Services ======
Created Tuesday 01 May 2018

== Overview ==
Service Management Facility (SMF) is the equilavent to the legacy init scripts on Oracle for managing services.

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/servers-storage-admin/intro-smf-basics-s11-1729181.html
Important commands to interact with services

* svcadm	Manage the state of service instances
* svcs	Provide information about services, including their status
* svcprop	Get information about service configuration properties
* svccfg	Import, export, and modify service configuration

== svcs ==
**svcs -?** will produce a list of common commands.

For example to list out currently running services

'''
jack@webserv:~$ svcs 
STATE          STIME    FMRI
legacy_run     12:43:42 lrc:/etc/rc2_d/S47pppd
legacy_run     12:43:42 lrc:/etc/rc2_d/S81dodatadm_udaplt
legacy_run     12:43:42 lrc:/etc/rc2_d/S89PRESERVE
online         12:35:17 svc:/system/svc/restarter:default
online         12:35:18 svc:/network/socket-config:default
online         12:35:18 svc:/network/connectx/unified-driver-post-upgrade:default
online         12:35:18 svc:/network/tcp/congestion-control:highspeed
'''
...
...

This output only shows currently running services, to show disables services, pass the **-a** option. Now we see disabled services as well.

'''
jack@webserv:~$ svcs -a
STATE          STIME    FMRI
legacy_run     12:43:42 lrc:/etc/rc2_d/S47pppd
legacy_run     12:43:42 lrc:/etc/rc2_d/S81dodatadm_udaplt
legacy_run     12:43:42 lrc:/etc/rc2_d/S89PRESERVE
disabled       12:35:17 svc:/network/tcp/tcpkey:default
disabled       12:35:17 svc:/network/install:default
disabled       12:35:17 svc:/system/device/mpxio-upgrade:default
disabled       12:35:18 svc:/network/ipsec/ike:default
'''
...

You can see the status of a single service by running the following command

'''
jack@webserv:~$ svcs -l ssh
fmri         svc:/network/ssh:default
name         SSH server
enabled      true
state        online
next_state   none
state_time   May  1, 2018 01:04:19 PM UTC
logfile      /var/svc/log/network-ssh:default.log
restarter    svc:/system/svc/restarter:default
contract_id  177 
manifest     /etc/svc/profile/generic_limited_net.xml
manifest     /usr/share/distro_const/profile/generic.xml
manifest     /lib/svc/manifest/network/ssh.xml
dependency   require_all/none svc:/system/filesystem/local (online)
dependency   optional_all/none svc:/system/filesystem/autofs (online)
dependency   require_all/none svc:/network/loopback (online)
dependency   require_all/none svc:/network/physical:default (online)
dependency   require_all/none svc:/system/utmp (online)
dependency   optional_all/error svc:/network/ipfilter:default (disabled)
dependency   require_all/restart file://localhost/etc/ssh/sshd_config (online)
'''


You can then enable or disable a service with the **svcadm** command. For example to start / enable the httpd service

jack@webserv:~$ svcadm enable http
jack@webserv:~$ echo $?
0
jack@webserv:~$ svcs http
STATE          STIME    FMRI
maintenance    14:40:45 svc:/network/http:apache22


(From http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/servers-storage-admin/intro-smf-basics-s11-1729181.html)
Each service on the system can be described using a Fault Management Resource Indicator (FMRI) that shows the service name, the service instance, and an associating category. For example, the SSH server has the following FMRI:

''svc:/network/ssh:default''

In this case, the service name is ssh, the service instance is default, and the category is network. All SMF-related FMRIs are prefixed with the svc:/ scheme, except for "legacy services," which are prefixed with the lrc:/ scheme, as we will see below. Administrators use FMRIs as the main way to manipulate services on an Oracle Solaris system. In some cases, we can use abbreviated forms to refer to the same service, which we will see a little later in this article.


==== Service States ====
From man SMF

   States
	   Each  service  instance  is always in a well-defined state based on its
	   dependencies, the results of the execution  of  its  methods,  and  its
	   potential contracts events. The following states are defined:

	   UNINITIALIZED    This  is  the initial state for all service instances.
						Instances are moved to maintenance, offline, or a dis-
						abled  state  upon evaluation by svc.startd(1M) or the
						appropriate restarter.

	   OFFLINE          The instance is enabled, but not yet running or avail-
						able  to  run.  If  restarter execution of the service
						start method or the equivalent method  is  successful,
						the instance moves to the online state. Failures might
						lead to a degraded or maintenance  state.  Administra-
						tive action can lead to the uninitialized state.

	   ONLINE           The instance is enabled and running or is available to
						run. The specific nature of the online state is appli-
						cation-model  specific and is defined by the restarter
						responsible for the service instance.  Online  is  the
						expected  operating  state  for  a properly configured
						service with all dependencies satisfied.  Failures  of
						the  instance  can  lead  to a degraded or maintenance
						state. Failures of  services  on  which  the  instance
						depends can lead to offline or degraded states.

	   DEGRADED         The  instance  is  enabled and running or available to
						run. The instance, however, is functioning at  a  lim-
						ited capacity in comparison to normal operation. Fail-
						ures of the  instance  can  lead  to  the  maintenance
						state.  Failures  of  services  on  which the instance
						depends  can  lead  to  offline  or  degraded  states.
						Restoration  of capacity should result in a transition
						to the online state.

	   MAINTENANCE      The instance was not able to start, stop  or  continue
						running.  Administrative action (through svcadm clear,
						after corrective steps are taken) is required to  move
						the  instance  out  of  the  maintenance state. If the
						instance is disabled, the maintenance state is  tempo-
						rary.  In  this case, if a svcadm clear is issued, the
						instance will not  re-execute  the  stop  method  that
						caused  the  instance  to enter the maintenance state,
						but will simply revert to the disabled state.

	   DISABLED         The instance is disabled. Enabling the service results
						in a transition to the offline state and eventually to
						the online state with all dependencies satisfied.

	   LEGACY-RUN       This state represents a legacy instance  that  is  not
						managed  by the service management facility. Instances
						in this state have been started  at  some  point,  but
						might  or  might not be running. Instances can only be
						observed using the facility and  are  not  transferred
						into other states.
