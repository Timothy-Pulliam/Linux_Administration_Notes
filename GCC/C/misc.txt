glibc
The glibc package contains standard libraries which are used by
			: multiple programs on the system. In order to save disk space and
			: memory, as well as to make upgrading easier, common system code is
			: kept in one place and shared between programs. This particular package
			: contains the most important sets of shared libraries: the standard C
			: library and the standard math library. Without these two libraries, a
			: Linux system will not function.
