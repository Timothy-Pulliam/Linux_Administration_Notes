====== glibc ======
Created Sunday 10 February 2019

==== GNU C Standard Library (glibc) ====
https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_mono/libc.html
There are many libraries which provide the standard C functions, however glibc is the one used with Linux.

From `man glibc`
	The  term  "libc"  is  commonly used as a shorthand for the "standard C library", a library of standard functions that can be used by all C programs (and sometimes by programs in other languages).

	The  pathname  /lib64/libc.so.6  (or  something  similar)  is normally a symbolic link that points to the location of the glibc
	library, and executing this pathname will cause glibc to display various information about the version installed on your sys‚Äê
	   tem.

https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/
The GNU C Library project provides the core libraries for the GNU system and GNU/Linux systems, as well as many other systems that use Linux as the kernel. These libraries provide critical APIs including ISO C11, POSIX.1-2008, BSD, OS-specific APIs and more. These APIs include such foundational facilities as open, read, write, malloc, printf, getaddrinfo, dlopen, pthread_create, crypt, login, exit and more.

The GNU C Library is designed to be a backwards compatible, portable, and high performance ISO C library. It aims to follow all relevant standards including ISO C11, POSIX.1-2008, and IEEE 754-2008.

== Install glibc man pages ==
To install the man pages for GNU C Library. This allows you to find man pages for functions in the standard C library (strlen, strcpy, malloc, etc).

'''
$ yum install man-pages libstdc++-docs
$ apt-get install manpages-dev manpages-posix-dev
'''


== glibc header files ==
The GNU standard library is defined by the header files. Below is a summary of the header files and what standard they were introduced at. These header files are located at /usr/include/

'''
Name		From	Description
<assert.h>		Contains the assert macro, used to assist with detecting logical errors and other types of bug in debugging versions of a program.
<complex.h>	C99	A set of functions for manipulating complex numbers.
<ctype.h>		Defines set of functions used to classify characters by their types or to convert between upper and lower case in a way that is independent of the used character set (typically ASCII or one of its extensions, although implementations utilizing EBCDIC are also known).
<errno.h>		For testing error codes reported by library functions.
<fenv.h>	C99	Defines a set of functions for controlling floating-point environment.
<float.h>		Defines macro constants specifying the implementation-specific properties of the floating-point library.
<inttypes.h>	C99	Defines exact-width integer types.
<iso646.h>	NA1	Defines several macros that implement alternative ways to express several standard tokens. For programming in ISO 646 variant character sets.
<limits.h>		Defines macro constants specifying the implementation-specific properties of the integer types.
<locale.h>		Defines localization functions.
<math.h>		Defines common mathematical functions.
<setjmp.h>		Declares the macros setjmp and longjmp, which are used for non-local exits.
<signal.h>		Defines signal-handling functions.
<stdalign.h>	C11	For querying and specifying the alignment of objects.
<stdarg.h>		For accessing a varying number of arguments passed to functions.
<stdatomic.h>	C11	For atomic operations on data shared between threads.
<stdbool.h>	C99	Defines a boolean data type.
<stddef.h>		Defines several useful types and macros.
<stdint.h>	C99	Defines exact-width integer types.
<stdio.h>		Defines core input and output functions
<stdlib.h>		Defines numeric conversion functions, pseudo-random numbers generation functions, memory allocation, process control functions
<stdnoreturn.h>	C11	For specifying non-returning functions
<string.h>		Defines string-handling functions
<tgmath.h>	C99	Defines type-generic mathematical functions.
<threads.h>	C11	Defines functions for managing multiple threads, mutexes and condition variables
<time.h>		Defines date- and time-handling functions
<uchar.h>	C11	Types and functions for manipulating Unicode characters
<wchar.h>	NA1	Defines wide-string-handling functions
<wctype.h>	NA1	Defines set of functions used to classify wide characters by their types or to convert between upper and lower case
