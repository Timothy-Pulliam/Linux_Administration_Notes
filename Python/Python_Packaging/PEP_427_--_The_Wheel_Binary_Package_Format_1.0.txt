====== PEP 427 -- The Wheel Binary Package Format 1.0 ======
Created Wednesday 10 October 2018
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427/



==== Abstract ====
A wheel is a ZIP-format archive with a specially formatted file name and the .whl extension.

''pip-18.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl''

It contains a single distribution nearly as it would be installed according to PEP 376 with a particular installation scheme. Although a specialized installer is recommended

$ pip install ''pip-18.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl''

a wheel file may be installed by simply unpacking into site-packages with the standard 'unzip' tool while preserving enough information to spread its contents out onto their final paths at any later time.

==== Rationale ====
Python needs a package format that is easier to install than sdist. Python's sdist packages are defined by and require the distutils and setuptools build systems, running arbitrary code to build-and-install, and re-compile, code just so it can be installed into a new virtualenv.

sdist = distutils and setuptools
