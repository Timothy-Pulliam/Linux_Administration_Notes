====== repositories ======
Created Monday 18 March 2019

There are four repositories that proxmox uses for packaging.

* Standard Package Repo - Standard Debian packages. Located in /etc/apt/sources.list
* proxmox ve enterprise repo - If you paid for a pve subscription, you get the most stable packages. If you did not pay for a subscription, you should comment this out.

	/etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-enterprise.list
		''deb https://enterprise.proxmox.com/debian/pve stretch pve-enterprise''

* proxmox ve no-subscription repo - If you did not pay for a subscription, you get slightly older, slightly less stable packages. Not suitable for production environments.

	/etc/apt/sources.list
	'''
	# PVE pve-no-subscription repository provided by proxmox.com,
	# NOT recommended for production use
	deb http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pve stretch pve-no-subscription
	'''


* proxmox ve test repo - As its name suggests, these packages are for developers to test new features. You really shouldn't use them.
