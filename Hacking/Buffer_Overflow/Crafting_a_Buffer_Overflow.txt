==== 1) Determine the attack vector ====

If the application is closed source, we must rely on black box techniques. We can wait for an attack to be published.

For open source solutions, we can read the source code.

Attack vectors could be things such as:

* filename length
* argument lenth
* http request body length
* file size (too big)
