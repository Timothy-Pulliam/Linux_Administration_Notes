====== Heap Overflow ======
Created Tuesday 19 February 2019

'''
#define BUFSIZE 256
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
	char *buf;
	buf = (char *)malloc(sizeof(char)*BUFSIZE);
	strcpy(buf, argv[1]);
}
'''

If the size of arg[1] is greater than the size buf permits (256) a heap overflow will occur. Heap-based buffer overflows are usually just as dangerous as stack-based buffer overflows.
