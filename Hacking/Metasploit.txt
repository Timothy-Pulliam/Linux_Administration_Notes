$ msfconsole

Display list of available commands
msf > help

Update the CVE database
msf > msfupdate

Search for available exploits
msf >search name:Microsoft [[type:exploit]]

Info about module or vulnerability
msf > info <vulnerability>

== Metasploitable ==

The intentionally vulnerable target machine for evaluating Metasploit

== Discovery Scans With nmap ==
Discovery scan is the first step in the pentesting suite. We must gain info about hosts on the network. We are looking for open ports.

get a list of IPs and MAC addresses for hosts on the network
msf >nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24

Get open ports, OS info, and more for specific host
msf > nmap -sV -O -T4 192.168.1.140

To keep a list of hosts in a database, we can use the db_nmap command, which saves all of this information for later use
db_nmap -v sV -O -T4 192.168.1.140

== Vulnerability Scan / Vulnerability Databases ==
https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/wmap-web-scanner/

In general, performing a Vulnerability Scan is obvious. It is much better to take the information we have from the Discovery Scan and manually search the database ourselves.

msf > search [[name:httpd]]

set the current exploit to be executed
msf > use <exploit>

While exploit is set, show available options that can be configured
msf exploit(<exploit>) > show options
msf exploit(<exploit>) > set <option> <value>

Trigger the exploit
msf exploit(<exploit>) > exploit
