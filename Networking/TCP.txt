==== Three Way Hand Shake ====
http://packetlife.net/blog/2010/jun/7/understanding-tcp-sequence-acknowledgment-numbers/

==== Terminology ====

== bits ==
SYN
		  A control bit in the incoming segment, occupying one sequence
		  number, used at the initiation of a connection, to indicate
		  where the sequence numbering will start.
ACK
		  A control bit (acknowledge) occupying no sequence space, which
		  indicates that the acknowledgment field of this segment
		  specifies the next sequence number the sender of this segment
		  is expecting to receive, hence acknowledging receipt of all
		  previous sequence numbers.

FIN
		  A control bit (finis) occupying one sequence number, which
		  indicates that the sender will send no more data or control
		  occupying sequence space.

PUSH
		  A control bit occupying no sequence space, indicating that
		  this segment contains data that must be pushed immediately through to the
		  receiving user.

RST
		  A control bit (reset), occupying no sequence space, indicating
		  that the receiver should delete the connection without further
		  interaction.  The receiver can determine, based on the
		  sequence number and acknowledgment fields of the incoming
		  segment, whether it should honor the reset command or ignore
		  it.  In no case does receipt of a segment containing RST give
		  rise to a RST in response.
URG
		  A control bit (urgent), occupying no sequence space, used to
		  indicate that the receiving user should be notified to do
		  urgent processing as long as there is data to be consumed with
		  sequence numbers less than the value indicated in the urgent
		  pointer.


== sequence ==
IRS
		  The Initial Receive Sequence number.  The first sequence
		  number used by the sender on a connection.
ISS
		  The Initial Send Sequence number.  The first sequence number
		  used by the sender on a connection.
ISN
		  The Initial Sequence Number.  The first sequence number used
		  on a connection, (either ISS or IRS).  Selected on a clock
		  based procedure.


== misc ==
MSL
		  Maximum Segment Lifetime, the time a TCP segment can exist in
		  the internetwork system.  Arbitrarily defined to be 2 minutes.

TCB
		  Transmission control block, the data structure that records
		  the state of a connection.

==== TCP Connection State Changes ====

  ''A connection progresses through a series of states during its''
''  lifetime.  The states are:  LISTEN, SYN-SENT, SYN-RECEIVED,''
''  ESTABLISHED, FIN-WAIT-1, FIN-WAIT-2, CLOSE-WAIT, CLOSING, LAST-ACK,''
''  TIME-WAIT, and the fictional state CLOSED.  CLOSED is fictional''
''  because it represents the state when there is no TCB, and therefore,''
''  no connection.  Briefly the meanings of the states are:''

	'''
	LISTEN - represents waiting for a connection request from any remote
	TCP and port.
	
	SYN-SENT - represents waiting for a matching connection request
	after having sent a connection request.
	
	SYN-RECEIVED - represents waiting for a confirming connection
	request acknowledgment after having both received and sent a
	connection request.
	
	ESTABLISHED - represents an open connection, data received can be
	delivered to the user.  The normal state for the data transfer phase
	of the connection.
	
	FIN-WAIT-1 - represents waiting for a connection termination request
	from the remote TCP, or an acknowledgment of the connection
	termination request previously sent.
	
	FIN-WAIT-2 - represents waiting for a connection termination request
	from the remote TCP.
	
	CLOSE-WAIT - represents waiting for a connection termination request
	from the local user.
	
	CLOSING - represents waiting for a connection termination request
	acknowledgment from the remote TCP.
	
	LAST-ACK - represents waiting for an acknowledgment of the
	connection termination request previously sent to the remote TCP
	(which includes an acknowledgment of its connection termination
	request).
	
	
	TIME-WAIT - represents waiting for enough time to pass to be sure
	the remote TCP received the acknowledgment of its connection
	termination request.
	
	CLOSED - represents no connection state at all

  ''The state diagram in figure 6 illustrates only state changes, together''
''  with the causing events and resulting actions, but addresses neither''
''  error conditions nor actions which are not connected with state''
''  changes.  In a later section, more detail is offered with respect to''
''  the reaction of the TCP to events.''
