==== .bashrc vs .bash_profile ====
This blog post summarizes the difference very nicely and also explains when you would want to use one over the other.

Basically, anytime you type in your username and password to access a system, you will trigger the [[~/.bash_profile]] to run. You will also enter a login shell.

Any time you open an new terminal window, or enter a new bash instance by typing [[/bin/bash,]] you will trigger the [[~/.bashrc.]] You will also enter an interactive non-login shell.

It is recommended to source your .bashrc from your .bash_profile so that even when you use a login shell, you still get the contents of your .bashrc

You can tell if you are in a login shell by running 
'''
prompt> echo $0
-bash # "-" is the first character. Therefore, this is a login shell.

prompt> echo $0
bash # "-" is NOT the first character. This is NOT a login shell.
'''
