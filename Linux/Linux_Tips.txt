== Bash Completion ==
Install Bash Completion
$ yum install bash-completion

== Fixing a broken chmod ==
You can run linux commands through the loader directly. For example, say you accidently messed up **/bin/chmod** permissions, you would not be able to set them back using chmod itself. But you could do it with the following.
* On 64 bit systems
	$ [[/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2]] [[/bin/chmod]] 755 /bin/chmod
* On 32 bit systems
	/lib/ld-linux.so /bin/chmod 755 [[/bin/chmod]]
