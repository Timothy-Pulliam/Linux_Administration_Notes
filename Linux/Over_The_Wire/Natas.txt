A new request to the website greets us with the following message.

Access disallowed. You are visiting from "" while authorized users should come only from "http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/" 

If we click on the "Refresh page" button, we instead get the following message.

Access disallowed. You are visiting from "http://natas4.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php" while authorized users should come only from "http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/" 

The "Refresh page" button simply takes whatever value is in the search bar and uses it in the message. So using natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php.
