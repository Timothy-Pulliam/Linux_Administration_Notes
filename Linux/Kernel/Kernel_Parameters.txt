Semaphores can be described as counters which are used to provide synchronization between processes or between threads within a process for shared resources like shared memories. System V semaphores support semaphore sets where each one is a counting semaphore. So when an application requests semaphores, the kernel releases them in sets. SEMMNI is one of semaphore settings in System V kernel. This parameter defines the maximum number of semaphore sets for the entire Linux system.
