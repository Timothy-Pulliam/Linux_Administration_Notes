====== yum-cron (auto updates) ======

https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-enable-automatic-security-updates-on-centos-7-with-yum-cron/

Use caution when auto-updating systems. Know that it is possible for an update to break your system. It is actually BAD PRACTICE to auto-update systems with yum-cron. You should instead
test updates on a staging version of your system before applying to a production system. Also know that a reboot may be required for updates to actually take effect. Anyways, here is how to use yum-cron
to make sure security updates are applied automatically.

Config file: **/etc/yum/yum-cron.conf**

'''
$ sudo yum -y install yum-cron
$ sudo systemctl start yum-cron
â€‹$ sudo systemctl enable yum-cron
$ vim /etc/yum/yum-cron.conf

# Only apply security patches
update_cmd = security
# Actually apply the updates
apply_updates = yes
# Email us about updates
emit_via = email
[email]
email_from = root@localhost
email_to = admin@company.com
'''

''$ sudo systemctl restart yum-cron''

You can exclude certain packages from getting updated by adding the following to **/etc/yum/yum-cron.conf** , for example to exclude kernel packages.

'''
[base]
exclude = kernel*
'''


==== Config Files / Crontab Entries ====
The main config files are located at 
* **/etc/yum/yum-cron.conf** (daily crontab)
* **/etc/yum/yum-cron-hourly.conf** (hourly crontab)

There are two crontab files that actually trigger yum-cron. The daily and the hourly crontab files.
* **/etc/cron.daily/0yum-daily.cron** uses the daily config file
* **/etc/cron.hourly/0yum-hourly.cron** uses the hourly config file.
