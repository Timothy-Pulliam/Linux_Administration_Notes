====== Create a Yum repository ======
Created Monday 28 August 2017

=== Listing Local Repos ===
Enabled repositories are ones which you can download RPMs from.
'''
$ yum repolist enabled --verbose
$ yum repolist disabled --verbose
'''


or you can list both enabled and disabled repose
	 ''$ yum repolist all --verbose''

You can change a repo from enabled to disabled in its corresponding **/etc/yum.repos.d/*.repo** file.

=== Creating a local FTP repository ===
Suppose you wanted to create a local copy of the CentOS 7 base repository. You also plan on sharing this repository via the FTP protocol. You would do the following on the server hosting the repo
'''
$ firewall-cmd --add-service=ftp --zone=public
$ firewall-cmd --add-service=ftp --zone=public --permanent
'''

'''
$ mkdir /var/ftp/pub/CentOS7_base && cd /var/ftp/pub/CentOS7_base
$ reposync --repoid=base
'''


You will then need to run the createrepo command on the directory where the RPMs are located. This will generate a metadata file named **repodata** which will inform a client's yum this is a local repository where it can find RPMs to download.
	''$ createrepo ./base/Packages''
	
Lastly, on any client machine that would be accessing this repository, you would need to create an **/etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base-Local.repo** file to instruct yum how to download these RPMs. Put the following content in this file:
'''
[centos-base-local]
name=CentOS-Base-Local
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
baseurl=ftp://192.168.1.51/pub/CentOS7_Extras/extras/Packages/
'''


You should then check on the client that the repo is enabled by running 
'''
$ yum clean all
$ yum repolist centos-base-local -v
'''
