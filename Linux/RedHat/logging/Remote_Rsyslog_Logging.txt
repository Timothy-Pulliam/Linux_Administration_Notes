====== Remote Rsyslog Logging ======
Created Sunday 20 May 2018

==== Server Configuration ====
Ensure the following is present in the /etc/rsyslog.conf file. We are using tcp reception as it is more reliable than udp.

'''
[root@elk log]# vim /etc/rsyslog.conf 

# Provides TCP syslog reception
$ModLoad imtcp
$InputTCPServerRun 514
'''


If you wish to run rsyslog on a non-standard port (e.g. 5514) you will need to set this in the config above, as well as make the following selinux changes.

'''
# semanage port -l| grep syslog
syslogd_port_t                 udp      514
# semanage port -a -t syslogd_port_t -p tcp 5514
'''


==== Client Configuration ====
1 @ instructs the host to send logs via udp, @@ instructs to send via tcp. Append the following to the end of your [[/etc/rsyslog.conf]] file


'''
[root@log-client ~]# vim /etc/rsyslog.conf 
*.* @@192.168.1.96:514
'''


Test your configuration with the logger command below, while tailing [[/var/log/messages]] on the remote server.

''[root@log-client ~]# logger "testing"''
