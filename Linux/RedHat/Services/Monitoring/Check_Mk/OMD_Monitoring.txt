====== OMD Monitoring ======
Created Thursday 31 August 2017

=== Server Installation ===
Centos and Redhat will require the Epel repository. 
	 ''$ yum install epel-release''

Redhat will additionally require these extra channels:
'''
subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-rpms \
--enable=rhel-7-server-extras-rpms \
--enable=rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
'''

Install the OMD Stable repository
$ rpm -Uvh "https://labs.consol.de/repo/stable/rhel7/i386/labs-consol-stable.rhel7.noarch.rpm"

$ yum search omd
$ yum install omd
Need to allow httpd to run network scripts
$ setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1
$ systemctl enable omd mariadb
$ systemctl start omd mariadb
# You shouldn't actually need to run the following commands.
__$ firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=mysql; firewall-cmd --reload; Is there a more secure way to do this?__
$ mysql_secure_installation

We must create a site instance. In many cases, there will only be a single omd site instance running.
$ omd create prod
$ omd start prod
Navigate to **http://<servername>/monitoring** to access the omd site's Web UI. The default username is **omdadmin**, with password **omd**.

Lastly, you can configure additional site settings by running 
$ omd config prod
Set the monitoring core to nagios, if it is not already.
$ omd start prod
More installation information can be found [[https://labs.consol.de/omd/#installation|here]].

== Client Installation ==
The server comes with the check_mk_agent client RPMs which can be copied over to any hosts you wish to monitor. Simply go to "WATO > Monitoring Agents > Linux Agents > check-mk-agent-xxxxx.RPM" 
Save the link from this agent, then on the system you wish to install the agent to run
$ curl -O -k $check-mk-agen-URL
$ yum install -y check-mk-agent
Make sure that tcp port 6556 is open on the agent, that the xinetd service is running, and that the [[/etc/xinetd.d/check_mk]] config file allows connections from the monitoring server. You can test that the agent is working on the client by running
$ check_mk_agent

You can test that the monitoring server can connect to the client by running
$ nc client_hostname 6556

Lastly, simply enter the client into the [[WebUI]] and save the results.
