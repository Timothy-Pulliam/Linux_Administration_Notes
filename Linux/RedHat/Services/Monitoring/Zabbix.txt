Runtime control
Runtime control options:

Option	Description	Target
config_cache_reload	Reload configuration cache. Ignored if cache is being currently loaded.	
housekeeper_execute	Start the housekeeping procedure. Ignored if the housekeeping procedure is currently in progress.	
log_level_increase[=<target>]	Increase log level, affects all processes if target is not specified.	pid - Process identifier (1 to 65535) 
process type - All processes of specified type (e.g., poller) 
process type,N - Process type and number (e.g., poller,3)
log_level_decrease[=<target>]	Decrease log level, affects all processes if target is not specified.
Allowed range of PIDs for changing the log level of a single Zabbx process is from 1 to 65535. On systems with large PIDs <process type,N> target option can be used for changing the log level of a single process.

Example of using runtime control to reload the server configuration cache:

shell> zabbix_server -c /usr/local/etc/zabbix_server.conf -R config_cache_reload
Example of using runtime control to trigger execution of housekeeper:

shell> zabbix_server -c /usr/local/etc/zabbix_server.conf -R housekeeper_execute
Examples of using runtime control to change log level:

Increase log level of all processes:
shell> zabbix_server -c /usr/local/etc/zabbix_server.conf -R log_level_increase

Increase log level of second poller process:
shell> zabbix_server -c /usr/local/etc/zabbix_server.conf -R log_level_increase=poller,2

Increase log level of process with PID 1234:
shell> zabbix_server -c /usr/local/etc/zabbix_server.conf -R log_level_increase=1234

Decrease log level of all http poller processes:
shell> zabbix_server -c /usr/local/etc/zabbix_server.conf -R log_level_decrease="http poller"
