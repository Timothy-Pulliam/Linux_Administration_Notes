====== NetBIOS ======
Created Friday 27 October 2017

[[NetBIOS]] is a naming scheme where every host on a LAN has its own [[NetBIOS]] name. The rules for [[NetBIOS]] naming are as follows

* max 15 characters in length, with the 16th character reserved as a [[NetBIOS]] suffix. The [[NetBIOS]] suffix identifies the **node type** of the host.
* Alphanumeric. Usually the hostname of the system truncated to 15 characters.
* [[NetBIOS]] names reside in a flat namespace, unlike DNS hostnames which are hierarchecal. As a result, no two hosts can have the same [[NetBIOS]] name with the same Domain.

You can display the netbios name of a Windows computer by opening powershell and running **nbtstat -n**
