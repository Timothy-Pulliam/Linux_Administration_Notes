====== SOA ======
Created Monday 22 April 2019

Defined in RFC 1035. The SOA defines the global parameters for the zone (domain). Only one SOA resource record (RR) is allowed in a zone file and it must be the first RR in the zone. (Though it may follow **$ORIGIN** or **$TTL** directives.)

NOTE: We are reliably informed that while a blank is a perfectly
      valid format certain DNSSEC signing tools may choke on this format.
