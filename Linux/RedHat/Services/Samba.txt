====== Samba ======
Created Thursday 21 September 2017

==== Overview ====
Samba allows for file and printer sharing with Windows and other Linux/Unix systems. It accomplishes this by using the Server Message Block (SMB3) protocol.  For example, if you have files on a Linux system that you need to share with a Windows system, you can accomplish this by placing the files on a samba server.

'''
The CIFS protocol is the successor to the SMB protocol and
       is supported by most Windows servers and many other commercial servers
       and Network Attached Storage appliances as well as by the popular Open
       Source server Samba.
