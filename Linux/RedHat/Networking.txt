====== Networking ======
Created Friday 25 August 2017

==== Setting Static Routes ====
https://www.centos.org/docs/5/html/5.2/Deployment_Guide/s1-networkscripts-static-routes.html
The default route can be set in the network script using the **GATEWAY=** setting. Simply edit this setting accordingly and then run
$ ifdown $interface && ifup $interface

You can temporarily add static routes using
$ ip route add dst-network via gateway dev device_name
$ ip route add 192.168.1.0/24 via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0


==== Layer 1/2 ====
Use **ethtool** command to get layer 1 information about an ethernet port (speeds, is active, etc.). For example, we see that the link below is capable of 10Gigabit/second speeds, but is currently only running at a 1Gb/s (possible because the switch it is connected to only offers 1Gb/s).

'''
# ethtool eth0
Settings for eth0:
	Supported ports: [ TP ]
	Supported link modes:   100baseT/Full 
	                        1000baseT/Full 
	                        
'''
__10000baseT/Full__ 
''	Supported pause frame use: Symmetric''
''	Supports auto-negotiation: Yes''
''	Advertised link modes:  100baseT/Full ''
''	                        1000baseT/Full ''
							__10000baseT/Full__ 
''	Advertised pause frame use: Symmetric''
''	Advertised auto-negotiation: Yes''
	__Speed: 1000Mb/s__
''	Duplex: Full''
''	Port: Twisted Pair''
''	PHYAD: 0''
''	Transceiver: external''
''	Auto-negotiation: on''
''	MDI-X: Unknown''
''	Supports Wake-on: d''
''	Wake-on: d''
''	Current message level: 0x00000007 (7)''
''			       drv probe link''
''	Link detected: yes''

If the link were down, ethtool would tell you it could not detect the link. This would indicate hardware problems (the ethernet cable is not plugged in, you are looking at the wrong network device).

Settings for eth0:
	Link detected: no

You can also get a plethora of Layer 1/2 information about a particular network device by navigating to **/sys/class/net**
''$ cd /sys/class/net/''
To see all available interfaces
''$ ls -l''
To see more information about the **eth0** interface
''$ cd eth0''
Then for example, to see the MAC address of this device
''$ cat address''
To see if the device is actually up (1 means up)
''$ cat carrier''
You can even see statistics about the device. For example, to see how many packets this interface has received since it has been up.
''$ cat statistics/rx_packets''
Lastly, you can get all of this information in an easy to read format using a simple grep
'''
# pwd
/sys/class/net/eth0
 # grep "" * 2> /dev/null
addr_assign_type:0
address:a4:bf:01:27:1b:67
addr_len:6
broadcast:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
carrier:1
carrier_changes:2
dev_id:0x0
dev_port:0
dormant:0
duplex:full
flags:0x1003

==== Layer 1/2/3 ====
Layer 3 information is fairly straightforward and can be obtained by simply invoking the **ip address** command (or **ip a** for short). **NO-CARRIER** indicates that their is no ethernet cable plugged in, or there is no Wi-Fi connection (either way, something is wrong at the hardware level).

==== Layer 4 ====
After IP addresses, the OS directs traffic via the use of ports. These ports are defined in the **/etc/services** file
$ head /etc/services


==== TCP / Netstat connection states ====
When you run netstat, you will see that a TCP connection can be in one of several states.

A connection progresses through a series of states during its lifetime. The states are: LISTEN, SYN-SENT, SYNRECEIVED,
ESTABLISHED, FIN-WAIT-1, FIN-WAIT-2, CLOSE-WAIT, CLOSING, LAST-ACK, TIME-WAIT, and
the fictional state CLOSED. CLOSED is fictional because it represents the state when there is no TCB, and
therefore, no connection. Briefly the meanings of the states are:

* LISTEN 
	represents waiting for a connection request from any remote TCP and port.
* SYN-SENT 
	represents waiting for a matching connection request after having sent a connection request.
* SYN-RECEIVED 
	represents waiting for a confirming connection request acknowledgment after having both received and sent a connection request.
* ESTABLISHED 
	represents an open connection, data received can be delivered to the user. The normal state for the data transfer phase of the connection.
* FIN-WAIT-1 
	represents waiting for a connection termination request from the remote TCP, or an acknowledgment of the connection termination request previously sent.
* FIN-WAIT-2 
	represents waiting for a connection termination request from the remote TCP.
* CLOSE-WAIT 
	represents waiting for a connection termination request from the local user.
* CLOSING 
	represents waiting for a connection termination request acknowledgment from the remote TCP.
* LAST-ACK 
	represents waiting for an acknowledgment of the connection termination request previously sent to the remote TCP (which includes an acknowledgment of its connection termination request).
* TIME-WAIT 
	represents waiting for enough time to pass to be sure the remote TCP received the acknowledgment of its connection termination request.
* CLOSED 
	represents no connection state at all.

A TCP connection progresses from one state to another in response to events. The events are the user calls,
OPEN, SEND, RECEIVE, CLOSE, ABORT, and STATUS; the incoming segments, particularly those containing
the SYN, ACK, RST and FIN flags; and timeouts.
