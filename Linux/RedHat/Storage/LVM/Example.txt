https://www.rootusers.com/how-to-increase-the-size-of-a-linux-lvm-by-adding-a-new-disk/

Add disk to system, make disk a physical volume, add disk to volume group, extend existing volume, resize filesystem.

Partition [[/dev/sdb]] (recommended https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/14010/the-merits-of-a-partitionless-filesystem/14017#14017)
# parted /dev/sdb
# pvcreate [[/dev/sdb1]]
# vgextend vg0 [[/dev/sdb1]]
# lvextend /dev/vg0/root [[/dev/sdb1]]
If ext4 filesystem
# resize2fs [[/dev/vg0/root]]
If xfs filesystem
# xfs_growfs /dev/vg0/root


== Grow a Logical Volume by expanding an existing disk ==

1) Expand the disk in the hypervisor and run pvscan
# pvscan
2) verify disk was expanded (lsblk)

3) Grow the partition the LVM filesystems are on
# parted [[/dev/sda]]
resizepart 2 100%
4) Resize the Physical Volume
# pvresize [[/dev/sda2]]
5) Resize the desired Logical volume as well as the filesystem on top
# lvresize -r -L [[+30GB]] /dev/mapper/centos-var
