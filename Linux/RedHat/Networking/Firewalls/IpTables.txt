====== IpTables ======
Created Monday 28 August 2017

=== Installing iptables ===
If you really need to install iptables for some reason, you can do so as follows
$ yum install iptables iptables-services

=== Using iptables ===
List rule chain for the current table. Note, rules are executed in order from top to bottom of the chain. If a rule at the top of the chain matches, later rules will not be executed. For this reason it is best to place most specific rules at the beginning of the chain and more general rules at the end of the chain. The last rule should always be one which drops any packets that did not match any rules.

$ iptables --list --line-numbers

Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)

1    ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere             state RELATED,ESTABLISHED
2    ACCEPT     icmp --  anywhere             anywhere            
3    ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere            
4    ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             state NEW tcp dpt:ssh
'''
	 __5    REJECT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere             reject-with icmp-host-prohibited__                     **<------ This should always be the last rule!!! It drops all other packets!**

''Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)''
''num  target     prot opt source               destination         ''
''1    REJECT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere             reject-with icmp-host-prohibited''

''Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)''
''num  target     prot opt source               destination''         

It is usually preferrable to use **iptables --list --numeric** options as the "--numeric" flag prevents DNS lookups which can take up time and bandwidth.

== Adding rules to iptables ==
Suppose we want to allow ftp access, and we want the rule to be processed 2nd.
$ iptables --insert INPUT 2 --destination 192.168.1.217 --source 192.168.1.200 --protocol tcp --dport 21 --jump ACCEPT
$ iptables-save
