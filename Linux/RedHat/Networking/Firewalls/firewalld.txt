====== firewalld ======
Created Tuesday 29 August 2017

=== Using firewall-cmd and firewalld ===

In firewalld, Network Interfaces are grouped into "Zones". Each zone has its own rules for filtering network traffic. For example, you might have a public zone for untrusted traffic, an internal zone for highly secure traffic and so on. You can view zone information with the following commands:

* Get just the names of available zones on the system
'''
$ firewall-cmd --get-zones
block dmz drop external home internal public trusted work
'''


* Get detailed information and rules for each zone
	 ''$ firewall-cmd --list-all-zones''
'''
block
  target: %%REJECT%%
  icmp-block-inversion: no
  interfaces: 
  sources: 
  services: 
  ports: 
  protocols: 
  masquerade: no
  forward-ports: 
  source-ports: 
  icmp-blocks: 
  rich rules:
'''
 

...output truncated...

* Get only the zones which have active firewall rules along with which network interfaces are using the zones.
'''
$ firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
public
  interfaces: eth0 eth1
'''


* Get the default zone
'''
$ firewall-cmd --get-default-zone
public
'''



=== Blocking A Spefic IP Address or A Range Of Addresses ===
Suppose you want to block the ip address 192.168.1.58. The following will give a "No route to host" network error message to the offending IP address. If you wish to give no error message to the offending client, you can use the **drop** zone instead.
'''
$ firewall-cmd --add-source=192.168.1.58 --zone=block --permanent
$ firewall-cmd --reload
$ firewall-cmd --list-all --zone=block
'''

To block a range of IP addresses, simply specify the subnet using CIDR notation
'''
$ firewall-cmd --add-source=192.168.1.0/24 --zone=block --permanent
$ firewall-cmd --reload
$ firewall-cmd --list-all --zone=block
'''


==== Creating New Services ====
http://www.firewalld.org/documentation/howto/add-a-service.html
You can define custom services using firewall-cmd. Services are groups of firewall rules. For example, on a freeipa server, you will need to open the following ports.
		TCP Ports:
		  * 80, 443: HTTP/HTTPS
		  * 389, 636: LDAP/LDAPS
		  * 88, 464: kerberos
		  * 53: bind
		UDP Ports:
		  * 88, 464: kerberos
		  * 53: bind
		  * 123: ntp

You can group these all into a single service (named freeipa) and then simply start the one service, rather than start each individual rule. This allows you to logically group firewall rules so they are started and stopped together if necessary.

The following command creates a new file named **/etc/firewalld/services/freeipa.xml**
'''
$ firewall-cmd --permanent --new-service=freeipa

$ firewall-cmd --permanent --service=freeipa --set-description="Firewall rules for a FreeIPA Server"
$ firewall-cmd --permanent --service=freeipa --set-short=freeipa
$ firewall-cmd --permanent --service=freeipa --add-port={80/tcp,443/tcp,389/tcp,636/tcp,88/tcp,464/tcp,53/tcp,88/udp,464/udp,53/udp,123/udp}
'''


Now if you examine **/etc/firewalld/services/freeipa.xml** you will see it has been configured
'''
# cat /etc/firewalld/services/freeipa.xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<service>
  <short>freeipa</short>
  <description>Firewall rules for a FreeIPA Server</description>
  <port protocol="tcp" port="80"/>
  <port protocol="tcp" port="443"/>
  <port protocol="tcp" port="389"/>
  <port protocol="tcp" port="636"/>
  <port protocol="tcp" port="88"/>
  <port protocol="tcp" port="464"/>
  <port protocol="tcp" port="53"/>
  <port protocol="udp" port="88"/>
  <port protocol="udp" port="464"/>
  <port protocol="udp" port="53"/>
  <port protocol="udp" port="123"/>
</service>
'''

Now, you can start this service just like any other service
'''
# firewall-cmd --reload
# firewall-cmd --list-services
ssh dhcpv6-client dns http freeipa
'''


If you wish to permanently delete the service. You need to reload firewalld in order for effects to be recognized.
'''
# firewall-cmd --remove-service=freeipa
# firewall-cmd --permanent --delete-service=freeipa
success
'''
	 ''# firewall-cmd --reload''

The *.xml config files are now deleted
'''
# pwd
/etc/firewalld/services
[root@omd services]# ls
freeipa.xml.old  test.xml.old
'''
