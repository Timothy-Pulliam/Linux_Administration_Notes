This was the contents of [[/etc/networking/interfaces:]]

'''
# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
        address xxx.yyy.zzz.mmm
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        gateway xxx.yyy.zzz.1
        dns-nameservers xxx.yyy.zzz.aaa xxx.yyy.zzz.bbb
        dns-search mydomain.nl

auto eth3
iface eth3 inet static
        address 192.168.4.1
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        gateway 192.168.4.1
'''

When I tried to bring the interface up I got an error message:

'''
$ ifup eth3
RTNETLINK answers: File exists
Failed to bring up eth3.
'''

the problem was the gw line in the eth3 entry. Of course you can only have one default gateway in your setup. I missed this because I was also trying to add routes to networks behind the machine on the other end of eth3.
In the end, removing the gw line in the eth3 entry solved the problem.

== Alternate Solution ==
For temporary network configurations, you can use the ip command which is also found on most other GNU/Linux operating systems. The ip command allows you to configure settings which take effect immediately, however they are not persistent and will be lost after a reboot.
If you no longer need this configuration and wish to purge all IP configuration from an interface, you can use the ip command with the flush option as shown below.
 
''ip addr flush eth0''
