====== ipv6 ======
Created Friday 12 April 2019

==== Overview ====
https://www.lisenet.com/2016/configure-unique-local-ipv6-addresses-on-rhel-7/

== IPv6 Address Format ==
The IPv6 address is noted as 8 groups of 16 bits (which equals 4 hexadecimal numbers), for example:

fe80:7eef:0000:0000:1000:002a:0003:0001

There are a couple of formatting rules: leading zeroes do not have to be written, and long strings of all zeroes can be summarised as ::. This would make the previous example look like:
fe80:7eef::1000:2a:3:1

== Common IPv6 Addresses ==
The localhost address is ::1/128, which is 127.0.0.1/8 in IPv4 format.

All addresses would be ::, what is 0.0.0.0 in IPv4 format.

Multicast address is ff00::/8.

== Unique Local Addresses (Private Networks) ==
A unique local address is an IPv6 address in the block fc00::/7. Unique local addresses are not routable in the global IPv6 Internet.

A comparison to IPv4 would be 10.0.0.0/8 or 192.168.0.0/16 networks.

== Link-local Addresses ==
The link-local address is automatically configured on each IPv6 interface, but does not allow for globally unique addressing.

To conform to standard /64 addressing on subnets, the actual link-local addresses are assigned with the prefix fe80::/64.

IPv6 requires a link-local address on every network interface on which the IPv6 protocol is enabled, even when routable addresses are also assigned.

https://serverfault.com/questions/242013/difference-between-link-local-and-global-link-addresses-in-isatap
Any IPv6 adapter should always have two IP addresses if you're using it for internet traffic - your link-local address and your global address.
Your global address is world-routable, so anyone anywhere in the world can see that IP address (although of course, there should be a firewall between you and them to stop them from actually accessing you).
Your link-local address is just for your local area network. Consider it the equivalent of a 192.168.0.1 or 10.1.1.1 address. They are not routable, and can be used for internal communications, so that if your world-routable prefix changes, you don't have to update all your IP references to internal IP addresses.
The only functional difference is that your link-local address is not routable, and your global address must be routable. There are issues where non-routable global addresses have been allocated (via DHCPv6) for whatever reason, your computer THINKS it has a routable IPv6 address when it doesn't, and then all your IPv6 connectivity breaks.

dadfailed indicates this ipv6 address is no longer in use (or it cannot connect to the gateway anymore).

Alternatively you can temporarily remove the address using ip command.

''# ip -6 addr del fe80::a1b:8437:6f93:9538/64 dev eth0''
