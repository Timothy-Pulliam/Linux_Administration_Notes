== On the phone ==
First, you will need to enable USB debugging by clicking on the release version of your phone repeatedly until you get the "You are a developer!" message. Then enable USB debugging and MTP (Media Transfer Protocol) over USB.

== On the laptop ==
To set up device detection on Ubuntu Linux:

Log in as root and create this file: /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules.

Use this format to add each vendor to the file:

SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="0bb4", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"
In this example, the vendor ID is for HTC. The MODE assignment specifies read/write permissions, and GROUP defines which Unix group owns the device node. You can get the information you need by tailing dmesg while plugging in your phone. In other words,

$ dmesg --follow

Plug the phone in and get the relevant information for the udev rules. It should look like the following.

'''
[ 5390.297238] usb 1-1: new high-speed USB device number 59 using xhci_hcd
[ 5390.447173] usb 1-1: New USB device found, idVendor=18d1, idProduct=4ee7
[ 5390.447178] usb 1-1: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3
[ 5390.447183] usb 1-1: Product: Nexus 6P
[ 5390.447187] usb 1-1: Manufacturer: Huawei
[ 5390.447190] usb 1-1: SerialNumber: 84B7N16709001731
'''


Now execute:
 sudo chmod a+r [[/etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules]]

==== Troubleshooting ====
If you get errors in dmesg like the following

''[ 5263.036046] usb 1-1: device not accepting address 57, error -71''

You have a bad cable, try another one. You can see what your particular error message means by inspecting the following includes file

''tpulliam@lappy:~$ find /usr/include/ -iname *errno* -print -exec grep 71 {} +''
...
...
''/usr/include/asm-generic/errno.h:#define	EPROTO		71	/* Protocol error */''
