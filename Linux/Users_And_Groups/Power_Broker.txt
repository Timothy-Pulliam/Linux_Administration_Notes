====== Power Broker ======
Created Sunday 02 December 2018

Power Broker (Power Broken, Power Borker) is a replacement for sudo that integrates with Active Directory via Kerberos.

# List commands user may run
pbrun pblist commands

# user groups that are permitted to run commands
[[/etc/opt/quest/vas/users.allow]]

# users that are permitted to log in
/opt/pbis/bin/config --show req

#Listing a User using Username: 
[[/opt/pbis/bin/find-user-by-name]] <username>

#DC information:
[[/opt/pbis/bin/get-dc-list]] <domain>

#Flush PB cache
/opt/pbis/bin/ad-cache --delete-all

#Get status and restart.
/opt/pbis/bin/get-status
/opt/pbis/bin/lwsm shutdown 
/opt/pbis/sbin/lwsmd --start-as-daemon

== Troubleshooting ==

As with all kerberos based auth systems, make sure the target system has both forward and reverse DNS records.

Case matters, make sure text is correct upper or lower case.
