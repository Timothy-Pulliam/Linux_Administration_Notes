====== Power Broker ======
Created Sunday 02 December 2018

Power Broker (Power Broken, Power Borker) is a replacement for sudo that integrates with Active Directory via Kerberos.

== lwsm service manager ==
Get service status
[[./lwsm]] list

Get info about a service
[[./lwsm]] info lsass

restart a service
[[./lwsm]] restart lsass

refresh a service (refresh lsass service) without restarting the service
[[./lwsm]] refresh lsass


# List commands user may run
pbrun pblist commands

== Active Directory / Domain Commands ==
 /opt/pbis/bin/get-status

Healthy result output:
'''
LSA Server Status:
Agent version: 5.4.0
Uptime: 22 days 21 hours 16 minutes 29 seconds
[Authentication provider: lsa-local-provider]
	Status: Online
	Mode: Local system
[Authentication provider: lsa-activedirectory-provider]
	Status: Online
	Mode: Un-provisioned
	Domain: example.com
	Forest: example.com
	Site: Default-First-Site-Name
'''

An unhealthy result will not include the AD authentication provider or will indicate that it is offline. If the AD
authentication provider is not listed in the results, restart the authentication service. For more information, refer to
the Troubleshooting document on the BeyondTrust web site.
If the result looks like the line below, check the status of the PBIS Enterprise services to make sure they are
running.

	''Failed to query status from LSA service. The LSASS server is not responding.''

To check the status of the services. Run the command as root:
	
	''/opt/pbis/bin/lwsm list''

Get AD domain the computer is connected to
./lsa ad-get-machine account

List domain controllers
./get-dc-list

Displays the time of the current domain controller for
the domain that you specify.
The command can help you determine whether there
is a Kerberos time-skew error between a client and a
domain controller.
[root@rhel5d bin]# ./get-dc-time
example.com DC TIME: 2009-09-08
14:54:18 PDT

Registers an IP address for the computer in DNS. The command is useful when you want
to register A and PTR records for your computer and the DHCP server is not registering
them.

* Register an IP address:
''/opt/pbis/bin/update-dns --ipaddress 192.168.100.4 --fqdn bvt-deb506-64.lampi.centeris.com''

* If your system has multiple NICs and you are trying to register all their IP addresses in DNS, run the command once with multiple instances of the ipaddress option:
''/opt/pbis/bin/update-dns --fqdn corp.example.com --ipaddress 192.168.100.4 --ipaddress 192.168.100.7 --ipaddress 192.168.100.9''

* Clear AD cache
Deletes all the users and groups from the cache.
/opt/pbis/bin/ad-cache --delete-all

* join domain
[[/opt/pbis/bin/domainjoin-cli]] join example.com <Administrator> 

* leave domain
[[/opt/pbis/bin/domainjoin-cli]] leave <Administrator>

== user / group commands ==
find user by name
/opt/pbis/bin/find-user-by-name mydomain\\trejo

Optionally set the level of detail of information that is returned. Example:

Find group by name
find-group-by-name domain\\groupname 

You can enumerate the users in Active Directory and view their members, GIDs, and SIDs.
The PBIS agent enumerates users in the primary domain. Users in trusted domains and
linked cells are not enumerated. NSS membership settings in the registry do not affect the
result of the command.
Note: To view full information about the users, include the level option when you execute
the command:
/opt/pbis/bin/enum-users --level 2
'''

List groups a user is a member of
'''

Number of groups found for user 'example\hab' : 2
Group[1 of 2] name = EXAMPLE\enterprise^admins (gid = 593494535)

List Groups in AD and view SIDs and GIDs for group members
/opt/pbis/bin/enumgroups --level 1

== Local Accounts Commands ==


== blah ==
# user groups that are permitted to run commands
[[/etc/opt/quest/vas/users.allow]]

# users that are permitted to log in
/opt/pbis/bin/config --show req

#Listing a User using Username: 
[[/opt/pbis/bin/find-user-by-name]] <username>

#DC information:
[[/opt/pbis/bin/get-dc-list]] <domain>

#Flush PB cache
/opt/pbis/bin/ad-cache --delete-all

#Get status and restart.
/opt/pbis/bin/get-status
/opt/pbis/bin/lwsm shutdown 
/opt/pbis/sbin/lwsmd --start-as-daemon

== Troubleshooting ==

As with all kerberos based auth systems, make sure the target system has both forward and reverse DNS records.

Case matters, make sure text is correct upper or lower case.
