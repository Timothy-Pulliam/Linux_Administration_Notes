====== SELinux ======
Created Saturday 26 August 2017

==== Make Your Life Easier (setroubleshoot) ====
Normally, SELinux policy violations are logged in [[/var/log/audit/audit.log]] as an "avc: denied ..." policy violation message. However, these messages are often times cryptic and useless. Wouldn't it be nice if the audit failure was in plain english, with the solution right there? That is where **setroubleshoot** comes in. In addtion to [[/var/log/audit/audit.log,]] plain english messages are stored in **/var/log/messages** along with the commands necessary to resolve any policy violations.

$ yum install setroubleshoot setroubleshoot-server

For example this message in /var/log/audit/audit.log:
	 ''type=AVC msg=audit(1504374275.275:820): avc:  denied  { name_connect } for  pid=22103 comm="httpd" dest=5000 scontext=system_u:system_r:httpd_t:s0 tcontext=system_u:object_r:commplex_main_port_t:s0 tclass=tcp_socket''



becomes this
'''
complete SELinux messages. run sealert -l 3c341b2e-2d50-4592-a888-d40dfca45f2a
Sep  2 13:44:39 localhost python: SELinux is preventing httpd from name_connect access on the tcp_socket port 5000.

*****  Plugin catchall_boolean (89.3 confidence) suggests   ******************

If you want to allow httpd to can network connect
Then you must tell SELinux about this by enabling the 'httpd_can_network_connect' boolean.

Do
setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1

*****  Plugin catchall (11.6 confidence) suggests   **************************
'''

Simply run the following command
''$ sealert -a /var/log/audit/audit.log > /path/to/mylogfile.txt''

==== Troubleshooting SELinux issues ====
SELinux logs to [[/var/log/audit/audit.log.]] Consider the following log entry

''type=AVC msg=audit(1550268643.892:261): avc:  denied  { getattr } for  pid=3563 comm="httpd" path="/var/vrhce2/index.html" dev="dm-0" ino=33577624 scontext=system_u:system_r:httpd_t:s0 tcontext=unconfined_u:object_r:var_t:s0 tclass=file''

scontext = source context
tcontext = target context

scontext and tcontext must match in order for for SELinux to work. Usually what you want is to make tconext the same as scontext using the chcon command

$ chcon -R ''system_u:system_r:httpd_t:s0 /var/vrhce2''

==== SELinux Booleans eplained ====
the **semanage** command which is part of the policycoreutils-python package has a command which explains what each SELinux boolean does.

'''
# yum install policycoreutils-python
# semanage boolean -l
SELinux boolean                State  Default Description

privoxy_connect_any            (on   ,   on)  Allow privoxy to connect any
smartmon_3ware                 (off  ,  off)  Allow smartmon to 3ware
mpd_enable_homedirs            (off  ,  off)  Allow mpd to enable homedirs
xdm_sysadm_login               (off  ,  off)  Allow xdm to sysadm login
xen_use_nfs                    (off  ,  off)  Allow xen to use nfs
mozilla_read_content           (off  ,  off)  Allow mozilla to read content
ssh_chroot_rw_homedirs         (off  ,  off)  Allow ssh to chroot rw homedirs
mount_anyfile                  (on   ,   on)  Allow mount to anyfile

==== Over NFS ====
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/storage_administration_guide/ch-disklesssystems

SELinux is only supported over NFSv4.2. To use SELinux, NFS must be explicitly enabled in /etc/sysconfig/nfs by adding the line:
RPCNFSDARGS="-V 4.2"
Then, in /var/lib/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default, change root=nfs:server-ip:/exported/root/directory to root=nfs:server-ip:/exported/root/directory,vers=4.2.
Finally, reboot the NFS server.
