====== tcp wrappers ======
Created Sunday 27 January 2019

==== Overview ====
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/security_guide/sect-security_guide-tcp_wrappers_and_xinetd-tcp_wrappers_configuration_files

TCP Wrappers allow a host to allow or deny access for services (http, ftp, telnet, ssh) to specific users, groups of users or specific hosts/IPs or groups of hosts or entire subnets. 

tcpd examines all incoming TCP client requests and then consults the following files the following order
1) [[/etc/hosts.allow]]
2) [[/etc/hosts.deny]]

tcpd stops at the first match. If there is a matching entry in [[/etc/hosts.allow,]] [[/etc/hosts.deny]] is not read. If no match is found in either files the traffic is allowed (implicit allow).

You can check your configuration with the following command

# tcpdchk -v 

If tcp wrappers is not already installed, you can install it with 

# yum install tcp_wrappers

==== Patterns ====

Entries are of the format

<name of service or process> : <user@source>

The following wildcards are available:

* ALL — Matches everything. It can be used for both the daemon list and the client list.
* LOCAL — Matches any host that does not contain a period (.), such as localhost.
* KNOWN — Matches any host where the hostname and host address are known or where the user is known.
* UNKNOWN — Matches any host where the hostname or host address are unknown or where the user is unknown.
* PARANOID — A reverse DNS lookup is done on the source IP address to obtain the host name. Then a DNS lookup is performed to resolve the IP address. If the two IP addresses do not match the connection is dropped and 			 the logs are updated

Messages for tcp wrappers are logged to [[/var/log/secure]]

==== Does this Daemon Support tcp_wrappers? ====
Check to see if the daemon uses the tcp_wrapper library

$ ldd /usr/sbin/sshd | grep libwrap.so
libwrap.so.0 => /lib64/libwrap.so.0 (0x00002b759b381000)
