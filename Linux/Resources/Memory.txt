Cached memory is good. It is the sign of a healthy system. It speeds up the system. **-/+ buffers/cache**: reveals the true amount of actual memory, including cached memory. When **free** under buffers/cache trends towards zero, this indicates the system is actually running out of memory and about to swap.
