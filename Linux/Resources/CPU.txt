from man uptime

'''
DESCRIPTION
       uptime  gives  a  one  line display of the following information.  The current time, how long the system has been running, how many users are
       currently logged on, and the system load averages for the past 
'''
__1, 5, and 15 minutes.__

From this description, you can tell if the load on a system is increasing or decreasing over time. In the below example, the load is actually increasing (slightly)
'''
$ uptime
 14:26:12 up 161 days, 12:21,  4 users,  load average: 1.14, 1.10, 1.09
'''




==== CPU Information with lscpu ====





==== CPU Usage History With SAR ====

To show what the cpu was doing at any given point in time.
# sar -u ALL

You may also want to know how many context switches the CPU is making per second. This records how often the CPU has to change tasks, which is computationaly intensive.

sar -w

An explanation of the values shown

-u [ ALL ]

'''
Report CPU utilization. The ALL keyword indicates that all the CPU fields should be displayed. The report may show the following fields:
%user 

Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at the user level (application). Note that this field includes time spent running virtual processors.
%usr

Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at the user level (application). Note that this field does NOT include time spent running virtual processors.
%nice 

Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at the user level with nice priority.
%system 

Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at the system level (kernel). Note that this field includes time spent servicing hardware and software interrupts.
%sys

Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at the system level (kernel). Note that this field does NOT include time spent servicing hardware and software interrupts.
%iowait 

Percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle during which the system had an outstanding disk I/O request.
%steal 

Percentage of time spent in involuntary wait by the virtual CPU or CPUs while the hypervisor was servicing another virtual processor.
%irq

Percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to service hardware interrupts.
%soft

Percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to service software interrupts.
%guest

Percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to run a virtual processor.
%gnice


Percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to run a niced guest.
%idle 

Percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle and the system did not have an outstanding disk I/O request.
