====== Playbooks ======
Created Thursday 14 September 2017

==== Overview ====
Assume that we have 2 systems, a server named **server.home** and a client named **client.home**. 

==== A First Playbook ====


The following should be done on server.home
* Edit the [[/etc/ansible/hosts]] file to add the necessary hosts

'''
[servers]
server.home

[clients]
client.home
'''


* Create variables for the clients and servers group.

'''
[ansible@server ~]$ mkdir /etc/ansible/group_vars
[ansible@server ~]$ cd /etc/ansible/group_vars
[ansible@server ~]$ vi servers
# Add the following lines
ansible_user: ansible
ansible_become: true
'''

'''
$ vi cients
# Add the following lines
ansible_user: ansible
ansible_become: true
'''

* Create the playbook
'''
$ vi ping.yml
---
- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Testing connectivity
      ping:
'''


* run the playbook


==== Playbook snippets ====
Below are snippets of simple ansible playbooks. They use YAML (YAML A'int Markup Langauge) and can be run with the following command using ansible
''$ ansible-playbook /path/to/playbook.yml''

=== Installing Packages ===
You will need to tell ansible to become the root user in order to install packages. You can do this by including
**become= true**

'''
--- 
- hosts: all
  tasks:
    -  name: Make sure we can connect to server 
       ping:
    -  name: Install Git
       yum: name=git state=present update_cache=yes
       become: true
'''

However, if you are going to be installing several pacakges, you will most likely want to just apply the become directive to the entire playbook, for example

'''
---
- hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Make sure that we can connect to the machine
    ping:
    - name: Install Git
    yum: name=git state=present update_cache=yes
    - name: Install Check_MK Monitoring Agent
    yum: name=check-mk-agent state=present
    - name: Install mySQL
    yum: name=mysql-server-5.6 state=present
'''

Lastly, you can consolidate the installation section further using the following syntax
'''

--- 
- hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    -  name: Install necessary packages
       yum: name={{item}} state=present update_cache=yes
       with_items:
         - autofs
         - nfs-utils
         - check-mk-agent
         - xinetd

'''
=== Starting Services ===
'''
---
- hosts: 192.168.33.12
  become: true
  tasks:
    -  name: Install Packages for monitoring and NFS/AutoFS
       yum:  name={{items}} state=present updated_cache=yes
       with_items:
         - autofs
         - nfs-utils
         - check-mk-agent
         - xinetd
       systemd: name={{items}} state=started enabled=yes
       with_items:
         - nfs
         - autofs
         - xinetd

'''
==== Misc ====
'''
5:48:37 PM - klep: kernel_panic1:   anytime you reference a module you want to precede with a "-" unless you preface it with a - name: descriptor
