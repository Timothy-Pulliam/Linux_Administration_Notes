Created Saturday 02 September 2017

=== Overview ===
Check_Mk is an extension to the Nagios monitoring system. It can be set up by itself, or it is included with the OMD Monitoring package. Check_Mk Raw edition is the free edition, as there are other licensed enterprise editions. 

You will need to install the check-mk-raw RPM on the monitoring server, and then install the check-mk-agent on any server you wish to monitor (including the monitoring server itself.

$ systemctl enable xinetd
$ systemctl start xinetd
$ firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=6556/tcp; firewall-cmd --reload

You can now add the client through the Graphical interface through "Hosts > New Host" You can also test the master can connect to the agent by running the following command with expected output:

'''
server.home:~$ nc client.home 6556
<<<check_mk>>>

AgentDirectory: /etc/check_mk
DataDirectory: /var/lib/check_mk_agent
SpoolDirectory: /var/lib/check_mk_agent/spool
PluginsDirectory: /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins
'''

Or you can simply run **check_mk_agent** on the client to get the same results.
