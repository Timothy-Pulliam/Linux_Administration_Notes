====== FTP ======
Created Saturday 26 August 2017

=== Basic Installation ===
Setting up an FTP server is very easy.

1) Install the very secure FTP daemon 
''$ yum install vsftpd''

2) Allow FTP traffic to the server
''$ firewall-cmd --add-service=ftp''
''$ firewall-cmd --add-service=ftp --permanent''

__WARNING! THIS IS NOT SECURE!__
3) Move any files to **/var/ftp/pub** directory you wish to access. Make sure they are readable by other
''$ chmod o+r /var/ftp/pub/file.txt''

4) You should be able to access the files in your browser
ftp://<server_ip>


=== Dual logging ===
By default vsftpd logs to [[/var/log/xferlog]] using a standard syntax. But you can enable vsftpd to log to another file simultaneously with a different syntax which can be helpful sometimes. To enable dual log files, edit the generic [[/etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf]] file to include the following:
# Log to /var/log/xferlog
xferlog_enable=YES
# Also log to [[/var/log/vsftp.log]]
dual_log_enable=YES

=== Enable Debug level logging ===
Start with the generic **/var/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf** config file. Make changes below. Note, debug level logging seems compatible with Dual logging.
# Log all FTP traffic
log_ftp_protocol=YES
# This will need to be disabled for logging all ftp traffic
xferlog_std_format=NO
