====== Server ======
Created Thursday 26 October 2017

==== Overview ====
{{.\pasted_image.png}}

==== Hardware Recommendation ====
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/linux_domain_identity_authentication_and_policy_guide/installing-ipa
RAM is the most important hardware feature to size properly. To determine how much RAM you require, consider these recommendations:
For 10,000 users and 100 groups: at least 2 GB of RAM and 1 GB swap space
For 100,000 users and 50,000 groups: at least 16 GB of RAM and 4 GB of swap space

==== Server Installation ====

== Preliminaries ==
# server = ldap.ipa.example.com
# client = client.ipa.example.com
# ntp server = ntp.example.com

#It is really important that both server/client hostname and ip addresses remain static. Not only must they not change, but they must also be present in /etc/hosts, /etc/hostname, and any A/AAAA/PTR records for DNS servers. Otherwise IPA will break. In other words, the following dig requests should return valid results.

$ dig ldap.ipa.example.com
$ dig -x $server_ip

# Optionally, if using IPv6
$ dig AAAA ldap.ipa.example.com

$ dig client.ipa.example.com
$ dig -x $client_ip

# In addition to standard A and PTR records for the ipa server, you must also create a SRV (service) records so systems know where to find the LDAP and NTP servers. This allows new client systems to automatically discover the ldap server upon installation and helps automate the client configuration process.
# https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg398680(v=ocs.15).aspx

# It should be configured like so
Domain = ipa.example.com
Service = _ldap
Protocol = _tcp
Port = 389
Host = ldap.ipa.example.com

# You must then verify this record is correct from any client by issuing the following dig command
$ dig +short _ldap._tcp.ipa.example.com srv
0 0 389 ldap.ipa.example.com.

# (recommended) It is highly recommended that you add a SRV record in DNS to point to an NTP server so that new IPA clients can automatically discover the NTP server upon intitial configuration. Otherwise they will think the ldap server is also the NTP server (which you may not want, especially if the ldap server runs on a VM).
# It should be configured like so
Domain = ipa.example.com
Service = _ntp
Protocol = _udp
Port = 123
Host = ntp.example.com

# You must then verify these records are correct from the client by issuing the following dig command
$ dig +short _ldap._tcp.ipa.example.com SRV
0 0 119 ldap.ipa.example.com.

$ dig +short _ntp._udp.ipa.example.com SRV
0 0 123 ntp.example.com

== Server Configuration ==
yum update -y
yum install freeipa-server ipa-server-dns samba
# You must add this server's A records to your DNS server for it to be accessible.
# echo $ip $hostname >> /etc/hosts
hostnamectl set-hostname ldap.ipa.example.com
echo $(ip a | grep -Po "(?<=inet )[0-9.]*" | grep -v "127.0.0.1") $(hostname) $(hostname -s) >> /etc/hosts

ipa-server-install --realm=IPA.EXAMPLE.COM --domain=ipa.example.com --ds-password=changeme --admin-password=changeme --hostname=ldap.ipa.example.com --ip-address=$IPADDR --mkhomedir --forwarder=$DNS1 --forwarder=$DNS2 --setup-dns

Next steps:
	1. You must make sure these network ports are open:
		TCP Ports:
		  * 80, 443: HTTP/HTTPS
		  * 389, 636: LDAP/LDAPS
		  * 88, 464: kerberos
		  * 53: bind
		UDP Ports:
		  * 88, 464: kerberos
		  * 53: bind
		  * 123: ntp

firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service={http,https,ldap,ldaps,kerberos,dns,ntp}
firewall-cmd --reload

	2. You can now obtain a kerberos ticket using the command: 'kinit admin'
	   This ticket will allow you to use the IPA tools (e.g., ipa user-add, ipa help commands)
	   and the web user interface (https://ldap.ipa.example.com).

# On the server
$ kinit admin
$ ipa user-add tpulliam
$ ipa passwd tpulliam

# For a full list of available ipa commands, run "ipa help commands"

# Configure DNS (named)

# In order for the IPA server's DNS to forward requests to our existing DNS servers, you need to make sure the following lines are present in /etc/named.conf (omit line numbers)

 14         forwarders {
 15                 $DNS1;
 16                 $DNS2;
 17         };   

# Also you must make sure to set "dnssec-validation yes;" to "dnssec-validation auto;". Otherwise, named will not provide requests from any untrusted zones.

$ named-checkconf
$ systemctl unmask named
$ systemctl restart named
$ systemctl mask named

== Uninstalling the IPA Server ==
It is often times useful when testing to uninstall and reinstall the IPA server several times to check that all of its features are working properly. To uninstall the server, simply run
$ ipa-server-install --uninstall


==== Client Configuration ====
yum install -y ipa-client
hostnamectl set-hostname client.example.com
#echo $ip $hostname >> /etc/hosts
echo $(ip a | grep -Po "(?<=inet )[0-9.]*" | grep -v "127.0.0.1") $(hostname) $(hostname -s) >> /etc/hosts
ipa-client-install --domain=example.com --server=ldap.ipa.example.com --realm=IPA.EXAMPLE.COM --principal admin --password=changeme --mkhomedir --hostname=minimal.example.com 



==== Removing Clients From IPA ====
You can disable a host or delete it entirely from IPA.

'''
[root@ldap ~]# ipa host-disable minimal.example.com
-------------------------------------
Disabled host "minimal.example.com"
-------------------------------------
[root@ldap ~]# ipa host-del minimal.example.com
------------------------------------
Deleted host "minimal.example.com"
------------------------------------
