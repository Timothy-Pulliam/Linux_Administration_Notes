====== NTP ======
Created Monday 18 September 2017

==== Overview ====
{{../../../../Admin_Notes/..images/NTP_diagram.PNG}}

==== Stratum Levels ====
NTP servers are categorized into different Stratum Levels depending on how close they are to the Time Sources where they receive the time. There are 16 stratum levels (0-15). Ideally you want to use a Stratum Level 1 server.

Stratum Level 0: These are the most accurate sources of time (atomic clocks, GPS, radio clocks). However they cannot be connected directly via Ethernet and so they need to be connected to a dedicated Stratum Level 1 server.

Stratum Level 1: A Primary NTP Server. Provides time to higher stratum level NTP servers.

Stratum Level 2: Possibly a Secondary NTP server. 

Stratum Levels 3-15: Higher stratum levels will give less accurate time because of how the servers are placed on the network physically and topologically.

==== ntpd vs. chronyd ====

chronyd is a newer version of ntpd. It is better suited for laptops, virtual machines, and other devices which will be powered off frequently. However chronyd cannot be an NTP server, thus if you want to run an NTP server, you must disable chronyd and install ntpd.

==== Configuration Files ====
* /etc/ntp.conf
	Really the only file that needs editing. see **man ntp.conf**.
	

==== Commands ====
* ntpq -p
	Print list of NTP peers known to server. When you add servers or peers to the [[/etc/ntp.conf]] file you can run **watch ntpq -p** to make sure ntpd synchronizes with the NTP server (you will know because there will be an asterisk next to NTP server's name once synchronized). Below is a description of the output:
	* remote - hostname/IP of NTP server or peer. Can be preceded by *,#,o,+,X, . , or - where 
		* o = server selected for synchronization
		* * = The host is currently synchronized with this NTP server
		* + = NTP server being considered for synchronization
		* # = server was selected for synchronization, however distance exceeds maximum
		* - = system not being considered for synchronization
	* st - Stratum level (1-16). A stratum level of 16 will not be used for time synchronization

* ntpstat
	show network time synchronisation status
* ntpdate
	set the date and time via NTP


==== Configuring ntpd Client ====
ntpd works as an NTP client out of the box. simply run the following

'''
$ systemctl stop chronyd
$ systemctl disable chronyd
$ systemctl mask chronyd
$ yum install ntp ntpdate
$ systemctl start ntpd
$ systemctl enable ntpd
'''

You can test your new NTP client using **ntpq -p** and **ntpstat**

'''
[vagrant@server ~]$ ntpq -p
     remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset  jitter
==============================================================================
*nu.binary.net   129.7.1.66       2 u   25   64   77   48.220   -8.388   9.663
 horp-bsd01.horp 164.67.62.194    2 u   41   64   33   52.662    2.303  14.259

'''
[vagrant@server ~]$ ntpstat

   time correct to within 99 ms
   polling server every 64 s
'''


==== Configure NTP Server and Polling client ====
We are going to configure an NTP server to use its own local clock for time. Then we will provide this time to a client. Note, this can be a good way to keep servers that are in close proximity within the same time, howerver this is generally regarded as inaccurate unless you also sync your NTP server to a server at **www.ntp.org** because you may end up being unsynchronized with proper time. I.E., your time may be vastly different than that of any *.centos.pool.ntp.org servers.

On your server make the following changes to **/etc/ntp.conf**
* Comment out the public servers and enable local clock
'''
# server 0.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
# server 1.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
# server 2.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
# server 3.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
# Use local clock
server 127.127.1.0
'''

* Allow NTP traffic to this server
'''
$ firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=ntp
$ firewall-cmd --reload
'''

* Restart ntpd
$ systemctl restart ntpd

Now we need to point the client to this new NTP server.
* Edit client's [[/etc/ntp.conf]] file like so
'''
#server 0.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
#server 1.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
#server 2.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
#server 3.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
server server.home
'''


* Restart ntpd service on the client.
''$ systemctl restart ntpd''
* check client is using server for time
'''
[root@client ~]# ntpq -p
     remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset  jitter
==============================================================================
*server.home     
'''
__LOCAL(0)__''         6 u    7   64  377    0.354  -101.84  46.556''

'''
[root@client ~]# ntpstat
synchronised to NTP server (192.168.1.212) at stratum 7 
   time correct to within 987 ms
   polling server every 64 s

'''


==== Configure NTP Peer ====
Assuming you already have an NTP server set up, on the host you wish to be the peer install the packages from the "Configuring ntpd Client" section. 
* Edit the [[/etc/ntp.conf]] as follows
'''
#server 0.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
#server 1.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
#server 2.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
#server 3.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
peer server.home
'''

* Open firewall for ntp traffic
'''
$ firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=ntp
$ firewall-cmd --reload
'''

* Restart ntpd
''$ systemctl restart ntpd''
* Check that the client is polling server.home for time

'''
[root@client ~]# ntpq -p
     remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset  jitter
==============================================================================
*server.home     LOCAL(0)         6 u   25   64   37    0.410    9.003  29.566
'''

'''

[root@client ~]# ntpstat
synchronised to NTP server (192.168.1.212) at stratum 7 
   time correct to within 1009 ms
   polling server every 64 s
'''


==== Configure a Broadcast Server and Client ====
You can also configure an NTP server to get time from a public NTP server and then broadcast the time to clients.

On the broadcast server
* Edit the [[/etc/ntp.conf]]
'''
server 0.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
server 1.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
server 2.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
server 3.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
broadcast 192.168.1.255
'''

* Open the firewall for ntp traffic
'''
$ firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=ntp
$ firewall-cmd --reload
'''
* Restart ntpd
''$ systemctl restart ntpd''
* Check that the broadcast server is actually broadcasting
'''
[root@server ~]# ntpq -p
     remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset  jitter
==============================================================================

'''
[root@server ~]# ntpstat
synchronised to NTP server (204.9.54.119) at stratum 2 
   time correct to within 260 ms
   polling server every 64 s
'''

On the clients 
* Edit the [[/etc/ntp.conf]]
'''
#server 0.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
#server 1.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
#server 2.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
#server 3.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
broadcastclient
disable auth
'''
* Restart ntpd
''$ systemctl restart ntpd''
* check that ntpd is receiving time (this can take some time)
'''
[root@client ~]# ntpq -p
     remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset  jitter
==============================================================================
*server.home     199.102.46.77    2 u    8   64   17    7.964  -20.948  20.756
'''

'''
[root@client ~]# ntpstat
synchronised to NTP server (192.168.1.212) at stratum 3 
   time correct to within 1170 ms
