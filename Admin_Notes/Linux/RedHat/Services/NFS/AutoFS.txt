====== AutoFS ======
Created Friday 01 September 2017

=== About ===
[[AutoFS]] is a client side service used to automatically mount and unmount NFS, CIFS, and other types of filesystems.

The main configuration file is located at **/etc/autofs.conf**. [[AutoFS]] uses Maps to locate filesystems that need to be mounted. The master map is defined in the main configuration file as **master_map_name="auto.master"** and has a default location of **/etc/auto.master**.

=== Installation (NFS Client) ===
$ yum install -y autofs
$ systemctl enable autofs
$ systemctl start autofs
$ systemctl status autofs

Really, that is all there is to it to start using [[AutoFS]] with NFS. You can then access exports from an NFS server as follows:
Show NFS exports for a server
$ showmount -e <NFS_server>
$ cd [[/net/<NFS_server]]>/<NFS_export>

Of course there are more configurations that can be done.

=== AutoFS NFS Home Directories ===
In order for users on the client machine to be able to access exports on the server, the same user must exist on both systems with the same username and UID. This is usually accomplished via LDAP, however you can simply create the user on both systems. In addition to this, the user's home directory must exist on the NFS server, but not the NFS client, as autofs will automatically create the mount point. Thus for testing, you can simply create user's like so
[root@server ~]# useradd -m user -u 1001
[root@client ~]# useradd -M user -u 1001

* On the server, you must export the home directories by editing the [[/etc/exports]] file
''/home           client.home(rw,sync,root_squash)''

* On the client machine, make sure you can see the server's exports
'''
$ showmount -e server.home
Export list for server.home:
/home client.home
'''


* append the following to [[/etc/auto.master]]
''/home	/etc/auto.master''

* Next, create the **/etc/auto.home** file, and add the following contents to it.
 * 	-nfs4,rw		server.home:/home/&

 * - mountpoint wild card. I.E. This rule applies to all NFS mountpoints.
 & - Wildcard that gets rewritten as the user's name doing the mounting ($USER).

Finally restart autofs and try to access the home directory as the user.
$ systemctl restart autofs
$ su - user


=== Troubleshooting Autofs ===

== Verbose mode ==
You can run the **automount** command in the foreground in verbose mode. This is usefule for debugging autofs.
$ systemctl stop autofs
$ kill $(pidof autofs)
$ automount -v -f

Then simply follow the errors in real time as you troubleshoot your autofs issue.

== Missing Libraries ==
If you see the following error message when running **journalctl -u autofs**

''Sep 16 18:06:24 server.home automount[3046]: open_sss_lib:78: lookup(sss): failed to open /usr/lib64/sssd/modules/libsss_autofs.so: /usr/lib64/sssd/modules/libsss_autofs.so: cannot'' 

You are missing the **libsss_autofs.rpm** package, which is a dependency for autofs. You fix this issue by simply installing it.
'''
$ yum install libsss_autofs
$ systemctl restart autofs
'''


==== TODO ====
usually a server's shares are stored in the [[/exports]] directory. Then the server will mount dircetories from this directory onto its own filesystem. For example

On server
[[/export]] - > /home

on server        on client
[[/export]]    -> /home
