==== connect: Network is unreachable ====
You need to fix your default route. Either reboot your system or run the ip route command.
$ ip route add default 192.168.1.0/24 via dev eth0

If you ever find yourself without network try the following:


1) It could be that the interface is simply down, or the configuration file needs to be re-read. This can be accomplished with the following command.
''$ ifdown /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/<interface_name> && ifup /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/<interface_name>''
2) If the network goes down after every reboot, make sure that **ONBOOT=YES** is set in the network scripts file if you are using a Dynamically assigned IP address.

==== No Network Interface During Install ====

If you are using an older motherboard with nVidia network interfaces (check with **lspci**) it is possible that you require the **kmod-forcedeth** kernel module, which is an older kernel module for RedHat to support your NIC. It used to come included with RHEL, but was taken out.

Download from ELRepo:
https://elrepo.org/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=kmod-forcedeth

Install on the target system. You will have to get the RPM on the target system somehow, either through USB etcetera:
$ yum install kmod-forcedeth-0.64-3.el7.elrepo.x86_64.rpm

Load the kernel module
$ modprobe kmod-forcedeth

and you should see your nVidia NIC come up. More information here https://liquidat.wordpress.com/2007/03/04/the-forcedeth-story/
